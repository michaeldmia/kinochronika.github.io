                Tatyana Bronstein is an independent film director and producer based in Boston, Massachusetts. She has directed documentaries and short narratives that have screened around the world.

            </p>
            <p>
                Bronstein's first feature-length documentary, <i>“From Russia, My Love”</i> debuted in 2003 to considerable acclaim. The film received an award for "Best Ethnic and Cultural Documentary" at the Worldfest-Houston International Film Festival.
            </p>
            <p>
                A decade later, her documentary,<i>"Prima"</i> screened at the Dance on Camera Festival, co-presented by The Dance Films Association and the Film Society of Lincoln Center. Abroad, the film was featured at the INSHADOW film festival, in Lisbon, Portugal.

                In 2014, Bronstein wrote, directed, produced and edited <i>"Love Me Again,"</i> a narrative short.

            <p>
                <q>"I believe in cinematic intoxication, when the story transforms into art and allows me and my audience to escape"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                My films are about people, their emotional journeys and personal transformations. One of the most beautiful aspects of our lives is meeting interesting people, listening to their stories, and learning from the experience. I use a cinematic approach to filmmaking, hoping to bring a unique feeling to these stories.
            </p>
            <p>
                The attempt to present stories as art is at the core of what filmmaking is for me. Ordinary methods don't impress me. I believe in cinematic intoxication when the story transforms into art and allows me and my audience to escape. This visual world, which I create with cinematography, sound, and music, is an important part of how I tell the story, hopefully, allowing my audience to experience the story in a personal manner. Art relies on the dynamic, unifying quality of the human mind, which is why each of my films leaves something to the imagination. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I choose my structures and visual styles to engage the viewer and connect with them on an emotional level. Currently, I work in a form that is both art and documentary, an aesthetic alliance between a cinema-verite and a poetic mode of representation. I often search for free and expressive ways to communicate beyond an orderly and typical arrangement of shots. Often, I experiment in developing a connection through a juxtaposition of isolated sequences and shots that would give more meaning to the film and allow scenes to breathe on their own, without infusing explanation, personal point of view, or direct manipulation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My documentary camerawork portrays reality in a way that attempts to uncover the life present within a human mind, the emotion, simply to find a fragment of a momentary truth. In opposition to my documentaries, surrealism is the basis for my short narrative films. Dreams embrace the visual, aural, and erotic forms within my narrative work, which freely exploit many experimental elements to tell a story symbolically. I am always seeking alternatives to the linearity of narrative construction. In my short narrative films, I let reality and imagination merge into a visceral, cinematically beautiful experience
